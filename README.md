## RFID

## Synopsis
This repository contains the major files written by myself on my summer internship (2016). They pertain to an RFID system (similar to the ones used in shops to stop theft) that  created that would track whether or not an item was within the 'room' at any given time, and alert a user in the event of changes. It was written mainly in python (tracker.py), but the automation of it also required parts to be in bash (restart.sh).

## Motivation
As said before, this was made as part of an internship. The motivation was to create a type of simple(ish) tracking system that could tell when an asset was in or out of the room. The code is needed to remotely acess the RFID tag reader and allow the database containing the data of which tags can be seen or not seen as appropriate. 

## Running/Installing
Unfortunately, due to the specific hardware that was used in the project, it is unlikely that the code will actually run as intended on your machine. I can assure you that meaningful data was taken and analysed using the code during the internship, however hopefully it may be of some help to you still. 

## Licence
This code was reproduced here with the permisson of my employers at the time, STFC.
